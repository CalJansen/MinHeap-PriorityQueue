CSE 310 Project 1- creating a MinHeap and makefile to run on general.asu.edu server.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project gives experience with both the heap data structure and experience with unix compatibility. 
The MinHeap has functions Initialize, BuildHeap, Insert, DeleteMin, DecreaseKey, and PrintHeap. 
These functions make it possible to build a MinHeap from a given file of integers and maintain the heap property throughout.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was programmed in C++ on Microsoft Visual Studio. The makefile and README files are both .txt files. 
The makefile allows this project to be run on the general.asu.edu Unix server.
